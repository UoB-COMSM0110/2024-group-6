## Snake

For snake we have short listed this classic game for many reasons. The top reasons that we picked this game were for its multitude of options and possibilities to be extended with new exciting inovative software devlopment features. As a group, we have highlighted the opportunity to extend Snake with features such as 2 player game play, added walls and eating smaller snakes. Each one of these features will give us, as a group, plenty to work on. The Two Player feature will enable two users on the same machine to play the same game. While adding walls will make it much harder for the snake to move around and access the much needed nutrients need for game play. To offset this we will include smaller snakes to increase the ability for the snake to increase in size.

### Prototype

Following creating a prototype for Snake, we quickly found many positives and negative associated though carrying out our development process. This included a change of name, good demonstration and not much in the way of a need to change the core elements of our design. Feedback quickly prompted us to change the name of the game to Snake Wars as the original was too similar to other games out there.  

## Flappy Bird

Choosing Flappy Bird as our inspiration brings a delightful challenge to the table. Our concept introduces several innovative features: Firstly, we can incorporate new patterns that allow players to navigate through pipes to reach new locations or maps. Secondly, we aim to enhance the bird's abilities through unique means, e.g. the ability to shoot lasers. Lastly, we propose adding new gates that redirect players to the starting point, elevating the difficulty level of the game.

*Right-click and select "Open link in new tab" to watch the video without leaving GitHub.*

We have ultimately chosen to base our game idea on Flappy Bird and transform it into "Super Spaceman" (the name may be subject to change). As demonstrated in the above prototype, we have introduced three new features: the inclusion of game props, such as heart items to increase lives and a prop gun to destroy debuff effects; alongside these, the addition of negative buffs (such as signs that immediately return the player to the starting point upon collision and signs that alter gravity) constitutes another new feature. The final feature allows players to either access another map through special new channels/portals, or to complete the game by traversing obstacles.

## Game Selection - Why we have chosen Super Spaceman

Although both games hold exciting potential, there was definitely a clear favourite throughout the research process, and the group has collectively agreed to pursue Super Spaceman. Ultimately, Super Spaceman has a greater scope for game features and creative opportunities. For Snake, we could not think of many challenges other than implementing walls, where as, for SSM, we were able to think of multiple categories, including various different hazards and power ups. So much, that we have had to spend time narrowing down which of our ideas to use. When researching these features, we concluded that SSM will also be more complex to implement, therefore providing us a greater chance to apply our knowledge and skills. Similarly, we feel more excited about the interface for SSM, and have already thought of different game maps. Our thoughts were confirmed in Mondayâ€™s lab, where we received positive feedback for SSM, and there was a general consensus that this was a more innovative idea and would be the most popular game.

## Usecase - Diagram

## Reflection

This week, our team gained valuable insights into the specific requirements of our game and we learnt lots about different player experiences. The task highlighted just how important it is to consider all potential players, as well as clearly understanding every playerâ€™s needs. We discussed specific ways to ensure that our game resonates with many. For example, including exciting and sophisticated features, whilst also being adaptable to those with disabilities. As a team, we enjoyed the process of collaborating and coming to these decisions, and due to our effective planning, we were able to produce a user story and use case that matched and reflected our initial game requirements.

However, when discussing our use case specification and creating our use case diagram, we realised that our initial plan was perhaps over complicated. We had some slight issues when defining whether something was an â€˜includeâ€™ or â€˜extendâ€™. Some of our members were unable to meet in person, and so when we came together to discuss our use case diagram, it was difficult to explain over the phone, specific things that we wanted them to change and why. This meant that we had to refactor lots, which overall emphasised the importance of remaining flexible throughout the game design process. Ultimately, this task was an important learning journey that provided us with a solid game design that we think will be open to many.

## Potential Challenges

Based on Flappy Bird, but the player can transport to different maps.

- Challenge 1 - Entering transport pipes -
- Challenge 2 - Data structure for storing the map - and changing it when they exit the portal pipes
- Challenge 3 - How to decide if the player enters a new map, or just a different location on the current map. (the control flow)
- Challenge 4 - Deciding where you go on the current map.

Extra notes:

- Generating the code for randomised hazards
- Implementing losing health when the player hits a hazards

# Qualitative Evaluation

Too collect Qualitative data for our game we will use two methords namly the Think Aloud and Heuristic Evaluation methords. This should provide us with the relevant with and depth of data to gain meaningful insights.  

## Think Aloud

Feedback 1 - game character movements, found issues in the sense that the character dies and also goes off the screen.  

Feedback 2 - pipes creation, need to create pipes.  

Feedback 3 - The pipes only generates randomly within the first three pairs internally, then simply repeats them continuously, resulting in only three distinct pairs of pipes indefinitely.

Feedback 4 - It would be easier to use the spacebar to control the character.

## Summary - Qualative Evaluation


The Heuristic Evaluation bought important issues about our game, to our attention. The issues primarily related to Consistency and Standards, but also the Aesthetic and Design of our game. The most severe issue related to our character interface. We found that the user needs to click many times to make the character jump higher, leading to a frustrating gameplay. This was a common issue, scoring 4/4 and led to a sum total of 4/4. We have decided to modify the character slightly, and increase the height of the jump per click. We have also decided to increase the gravity rate. This is because we found that the character fell too slowly, making it difficult to progress further through the game.

We noted issues relating to the Movements and Pipes interfaces of our game. This included the distances between pipes being too large, the pipes not generating randomly and the character falling off the screen. Although the issues individually are relatively minor, accumulated together they are noticeably persistent and severe (3/4), and overall leads to a rather â€˜sketchyâ€™ gameplay. Therefore, we have decided to reset the judgements of collision, narrow the distance between pipes and ensure that the pipes pattern does not continuously repeat. This not only improves the Consistency and Standards usability, but also the Aesthetic and Minimalist Design usability.

## Summary - Quantitative Evaluation

"Summary of data - Cecily??"

# Sprint 1

## Improvments:

> SUS - "I found the system unnecessarily complex", when the results were analysed we found this quesition inparticularly scored low. To improve this scoure we embarked on a program too add a splash screen and a you have died screen that returns users to the splash screen. We have designed it as such that the user much click the screen to go back to the start screen as prior to this we allowed it to be done with keys though the user would hold down the keys and would end up in a sudo infinate loop senario untill the key was lifter. 

> Make improvments to the collisions. The character before we made the changes would not die if it hit the top or bottom of the screen. We added collision to detect this and now the character does indeed die upone such impact with the top and bottom of the screen. 

> Increased the amount of "G-force" applyed to the character so that it falls quicker. At present the character falls too slowley. This means that by no falt of the user the character colides into obsticals(mainly pipes) as the character does not fall quicker enough. We changed this so that now the character does fall much quicker. To ofset this we have also had to increase the deltaY which is used to move the character up upone jumping.

8. Conclusion (10% ~500 words)

Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work.

Â· Quality of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%)

Â· Documentation of code (5%)

Â· Individual contribution. Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent.
